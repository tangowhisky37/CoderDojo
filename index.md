## What Is A CoderDojo

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community based programming clubs for young people. We are the Altona North (Melbourne, Australia) chapter of this amazing initiative!

At CoderDojo Altona North, young people aged between 7 and 17, learn how to code (Scratch, Python, etc.), interact with the real world using sensors and the Arduino, develop programs on the Raspberry Pi, develop websites, develop mobile apps, develop simple programs, develop games, build robots and explore various aspects of technology in an informal, safe, and creative environment. In addition to learning to code, exploring the basics of electronics and robotics, attendees meet like minded people and are exposed to a world of possibilities of technology. An individuals creativity is the only limit.

At CoderDojo Altona North our aim is to Ignite, Inspire and Create. We strongly believe that every child is a born  maker. What she/he needs is the right environment to Ignite those interests and Inspire them to Create. At CoderDojo Altona North there is a strong focus on community, peer learning, youth mentoring and self led learning, with an emphasis on showing how coding, making and hacking is a force for change in the world.

We might consider folowing a syllabus where it makes sense, especially with our young makers who are getting started. With the more experienced makers we will let the kids choose what they want to work on, and the mentors guide and help them along their journey of discovery into the world of technology. Some of the things we do at CoderDojo Altona North include:

- Introduction to Computer Science through -
  - Coding in Scratch
  - Google CS (Computer Science) First curriculum
  - Microsoft Computer Science curriculum using Minecraft
- Python developing on the Raspberry Pi

## Can I Volunteer & Inspire

Are you keen to be part of an amazing global movement? Are you keen to help craft the Australian tech minds of tomorrow in your local community? If so, then you should become a volunteer mentor at CoderDojo Altona North.

Whether you are a Python gun, can write HTML blindfolded, or love tinkering with hardware like Raspberry Pis or Arduinos or love tinkering with home built robots, your knowledge and experience would be welcome at our sessions! However, you don’t necessarily need to be a coding rockstar to help us out. Even if you can just give a hand with the organising, and general running of the dojo, then we’d still love to hear from you. You just need to be cool, great at supporting kids, and passionate. That’s all we ask for!

You’ll need a [Working With Children Check](http://www.workingwithchildren.vic.gov.au/), if you’d like to become a mentor with us. The application is free when it’s for volunteering purposes, and once you submit your form at the post office then you’re good to go – you don’t have to wait for the card to be posted out to you.

Finally, we don’t expect our volunteer mentors to attend each and every session. All we ask for is a few hours of your time each week when the dojo is running. If you can’t make a session, then that’s no problem! We’re operate a fun, relaxed, and flexible model for our awesome mentors!

If this sounds like something you’d love to do, then what are you waiting for! Drop us a note at volunteer@hack2.live and let's get the next generation of kids hacking.
